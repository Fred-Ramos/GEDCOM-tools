Return ONLY the modified GEDCOM file with no explanations or additional text. Extract missing date/place information from Portuguese NOTES and add PLAC/DATE fields under BIRT, DEAT, BURI, BAPM, or EVEN Marriage. If nationality is mentioned (like "português", "brasileiro") and no birth place is found, use that as birth place. Follow GEDCOM format exactly: for events add "2 DATE" and "2 PLAC" lines under the existing event entries. Do not add any text before or after the GEDCOM content.
